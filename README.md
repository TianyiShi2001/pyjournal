# pyjournal â€” Journal Article Automatic Download & Renaming

## Why pyjournal?

Have you been annoyed about...

- logging in journal sites again and again (due to cookie expiry)
- redundant login procedures (find login button (some are hard to find) => find your institution => institution login)
- the links (login, pdf download, citation record) that are hard to find. Consider [JBC](http://www.jbc.org/content/early/2019/10/30/jbc.RA119.009424.abstract). Can you find the citation link?
- new tabs that are forced to open
- renaming downloaded pdfs with readable names

The mission of pyjournal is to subdue these distractions and allow users to focus on their research.
